**Obtain a data product in its entirety**: <br><br>
This function is used to download data products without filtering over time or location (although location can be filtered). This functionality requires a product ID, which will need to be obtained via NEON's [search portal](http://data.neonscience.org/static/browse.html). Optionally, one NEON site can be selected. Otherwise, the option will default to 'all'.
