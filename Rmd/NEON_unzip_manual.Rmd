Select the **.zip** file that was downloaded from the NEON [search portal](http://data.neonscience.org/static/browse.html). This is a list of the files in the directory containing **Calliope View**, *before* this app was loaded. If you cannot find your **.zip** file, restart the app (sorry- no way of updating list) or check its directory.
