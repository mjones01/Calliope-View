# Calliope-View
An interactive leaflet interface designed to display ecological data alongside drone imaging.
## Overview
This R Shiny app uses leaflet to display ecological data provided by [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/) alongside drone imaging under one map. Users will then be able to compare biological statistics such as precipitation, soil temperature, humidity, and pressure with their own data to generate analyses ranging from the effects of climate change to the relationship between geographical factors and ecosystem.
[NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/) is a "continental-scale ecological observation facility" that provides open data on our ecosystems. [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/) is the source that this app pulls from to get ecological data.
